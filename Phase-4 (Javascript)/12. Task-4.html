<!-- Task:4


Write a JavaScript program that first uses the alert box to display a welcome message to the user (Example: Welcome
User). Then, use the confirm box to ask the user if they want to continue.
1. If the user clicks "OK", proceed to ask for their name using the prompt box and display a personalized greeting
(Example: If user enters “Jack”, then display “Hello Jack”). After displaying the greeting using alert box, prompt the
user to enter their age.
Based on the user's age, use a conditional statement to check if they are 18 or older. If the user is 18 or older,
display an alert saying "You are an adult!". If the user is under 18, display an alert saying "You are a minor!".
2. If the user clicks "Cancel" in the confirm box at the beginning, display an alert saying "Goodbye". -->
