<!-- Task:3

Create a function registerUser() that uses pop-up boxes to gather and validate user input for a new user registration.

The function should:

1. Use a while loop to repeatedly prompt the user for a username using the prompt() pop-up box. The loop should continue
to run as long as the user's input is an empty string, null, or undefined.
2. Once a valid username is provided, use another while loop to prompt the user for a password. This loop should
continue until the user provides a password that is at least 8 characters long.
3. After a valid password is entered, use the confirm() pop-up box to ask the user, "Are you sure you want to register
with this username and password?".
4. If the user clicks "Cancel" on the confirmation box, use alert() to display a message "Registration canceled." and
end the function.
5. If the user clicks "OK", use a template literal to display a final alert() message confirming the successful
registration, showing both the username and the password. -->
